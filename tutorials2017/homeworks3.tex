\section{Weak focusing synchrotron}
\label{problem1}
We consider a weak focusing synchrotron composed of 4 periods ``F-O'' where the straight sections ``O'' have a length $l$ and the bending sections ``F'' have a length $L$.

Derive the transfer matrix of one period. 

Establish the stability conditions on $l$ to obtain horizontal and vertical stability.

Derive the expression for $\nu$ in both planes as a function of the field-index $n$ and $\delta = R/\rho$.
